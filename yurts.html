            The Yurts at Pacific Trails

    <p> 
            <dt><b>What is a yurt?</b> </dt>
                <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. 
                    Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.
                </dd>
            <dt><b>How are the yurts furnished?</b> </dt>
                <dd> Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. 
                    Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water.
                    Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.
                </dd>
            <dt><b>What should I bring?</b> </dt>
                <dd> Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing.
                    It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
