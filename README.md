# COSC-Y200
## Assignment Submission Details
### File Names
All files MUST be named correctly as the assignment dictates. This includes spacing (don't use any!), capitalization, and the correct extensions. Major points will be taken off for incorrect file names and/or missing files. 
### Header Information
Please include all requested documents (HTML and/or CSS files) for this assignment in this repository. Each file MUST include a comment area just before the body or at the top of the page. The comment area must include the following three lines. All assignments for the remainder of this course must contain a variation of the following three lines. You will need to fill in the bracketed sections with the appropriate information (without the square brackets).
```
Project Name: [Title of the Project]
Author: [Your Full Name]
Date Last Modified: [Date Modified]
```
### Proper HTML tags
Each HTML file must utilize the proper HTML tags. You can use previous assignments as templates. Your pages must include (at the very least) the tags for DOCTYPE, html, head, title, body, and meta charset.  All open tags must be closed properly and in the correct order/location.
### Submitting for Evaluation and Grading
Using github desktop, submit your files for review by **committing** and **pushing** your changes. You will then need to create a **pull request** to the branch for this assignment. 

I will only look at the latest versions of your files (your last pull request). I will provide brief feedback via your git pull and a formal grade on blackboard.
